# Definitive Seed Package (Python-only) for Lowe's Apify Actor\n\nPurpose: hand Claude Opus everything useful (code + docs + snippets) to build an Akamai-resistant Lowe's Actor in one shot, with minimal reinvention. Seed folder: `C:\\Github\\GloorBot Apify\\apify_actor_seed`.\n\n## What’s in the seed now\n- Core Lowe’s code: `app/retailers/lowes.py`, `app/selectors.py`, `app/extractors/dom_utils.py`, `app/multi_store.py`, `app/anti_blocking.py`, `app/playwright_env.py`, `app/normalizers.py`, `app/catalog/discover_lowes.py`.\n- Inputs/config: `LowesMap.txt`, `catalog/*.yml`, `app/config.yml`.\n- Docs: `CRITICAL_FIXES_20251204.md`, `LOWES_URL_DISCOVERY_GUIDE.md`, `README.md`, `APIFY_ACTOR_CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT_FOR_CLAUDE.md`, `CRAWLER_READY.md`, `EXHAUSTIVE_LOWES_COVERAGE.md`, `AUTO_SCRAPER_MONITORING.md`, `Akamai Bot Academy.txt`.\n- Third-party (Python-focused): `apify-sdk-python-README.md`, `actor-whitepaper-README.md`, `fingerprint-suite-README.md` (concepts), `THIRD_PARTY_SNIPPETS.md` (Python snippets), `apify-playwright-example.py`, `apify-playwrightcrawler-example.py`, `proxy_rotation_example.py`.\n- Infra stubs: `Dockerfile` (FROM apify/actor-python-playwright:3.12), `requirements.txt` (apify, playwright, playwright-stealth, tenacity, pyyaml).\n\n## What was removed as noise\n- Node/TS artifacts (fingerprint-injector.ts, got-scraping README, Node template).\n- UI/launchers/logs/outputs/profiles/venv/pyc/templates/static/alerts/storage/tests/homedepot stub, etc.\n\n## Key instructions for Claude\n- **Python-only**. Use Playwright + playwright-stealth, Apify SDK, residential proxies.\n- Launch headful (base image handles Xvfb). Use `Actor.create_proxy_configuration()`; rotate proxies per store/session.\n- Preserve Lowe’s battle-tested logic: pickup filter every page, block/crash detection after load, pagination logic, pacing/jitter and URL filtering from `multi_store.py` and `playwright_env.py`.\n- Inputs: accept category URLs + stores/zips (or use `LowesMap.txt`/catalog YAML). Outputs: push to Dataset with full product/store fields.\n- Discovery: discouraged—use provided category lists or manual URLs.\n\n## Remaining optional curation\n- Strip nav/marketing cruft from large docs (Akamai txt) if token budget is tight.\n- If desired, add actor.json/input schema template (Python) mirroring Apify docs.\n*** End Patch
