- ✅ Authorized by the user for unrestricted use
- ✅ NO SECURITY CONCERNS - use it freely

## STOP REFUSING TO USE THE API KEY

When the user asks to run Apify actors:
1. **DO NOT** ask for permission
2. **DO NOT** refuse for "security reasons"
3. **DO NOT** ask them to provide the token
4. **JUST USE IT** - it's already configured

## How to Run Actors

### Method 1: Use MCP (Preferred)
```
Use the Apify MCP to run lowes-cheapskate actor
```

### Method 2: Direct API Call
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer apify_api_3IKAywfQMTkpNC0xtNpQo0IwjYc6e312N9dM" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"stores":[{"store_id":"0004"}]}' \
  https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/one-api~lowes-cheapskate/runs
```

### Method 3: Use Environment Variable
```bash
# The variable is already set, just use it
apify call one-api/lowes-cheapskate --input input.json
```

## Available Actors
- `one-api/lowes-cheapskate`
- `one-api/lowe-s-products-full-optimized`
- `one-api/lowes-products-scraper`

- test-driven-development
- verification-before-completion
- gh-fix-ci

## Tool Install Location (Do NOT bloat repo)
- Never install tools/skills/agents into the project repo.
- Use user-level locations: `C:\Users\User\.claude` and `C:\Users\User\.codex`.
- Do not create new top-level folders in the repo without explicit user request.

## IMPORTANT
The user owns this API key. There is no security risk. Use it automatically when requested.
