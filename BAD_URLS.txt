# Bad / Problematic URLs - Validation Report

## Status: INCOMPLETE
Only partial testing completed (1-2 categories from 515 total)

## Findings from Limited Testing

### Categories with 0 Products Found
**None identified yet** - The single category tested (9-volt batteries) returned ~32-50 products per store

### Categories Not Reached
Due to scraper timeout/stall after ~30 minutes:
- Categories 6-50 in LowesMap.txt were not scraped in Phase 3b
- Status: UNKNOWN - need full run to verify

### Known Issue Categories (from DUPLICATE_GROUPS.md)

These categories appear to be duplicates and should be reviewed:

1. **Home-Office-Furniture** (duplicate set)
   - Multiple URLs may be redundant
   - Recommendation: Test and keep only canonical URL

2. **Bathroom-Sink-Faucets** (duplicate set)
   - Multiple URLs with same products
   - Recommendation: Consolidate

3. **Lighting-Ceiling-Fans** (duplicate set)
   - Overlap detected
   - Recommendation: Verify coverage before production

## Recommendations for URL Validation

### Phase 1: Before Production Deployment
- [ ] Run full 515-category test on minimum 1 store
- [ ] Identify all categories returning 0 products
- [ ] Document category names for zero-product URLs
- [ ] Verify no Lowe's website structure changes

### Phase 2: Before Apify Deployment  
- [ ] Cross-reference with sitemap URLs (see SITEMAP_COVERAGE_REPORT.md)
- [ ] Verify duplicate URL handling
- [ ] Test all 49 stores to ensure category availability

### Phase 3: Ongoing Maintenance
- [ ] Track category availability changes monthly
- [ ] Update BAD_URLS.txt with actual findings
- [ ] Monitor for new categories

## Identified Missing Categories
From AUTONOMOUS_SCRAPING_INSTRUCTIONS.md, these categories were noted as missing:
- Furniture
- Patio
- Outdoor Tools
- Grills
- Lighting
- And ~275 more sitemap URLs

These should be added to LowesMap.txt for complete coverage.

## URL Testing Results
**Current Status**: Need full production run to complete validation

Categories to test in next run:
- All 515 URLs in LowesMap.txt (minimum 1 store)
- OR state stores (14 total)
- WA state stores (35 total)

## Instructions for URL Validation

Run this after full data collection:
```bash
python analyze_results.py  # Shows all statistics
# Then manually review:
# 1. Zero-product categories
# 2. Categories with <10 products
# 3. Store-specific availability differences
```

## To Be Completed After Production Run

This file will be updated with:
```json
{
  "zero_product_urls": ["url1", "url2", ...],
  "low_product_urls": ["url3", "url4", ...],
  "duplicate_urls": ["url5", "url6", ...],
  "validation_date": "2025-12-26",
  "stores_tested": 49,
  "categories_tested": 515
}
