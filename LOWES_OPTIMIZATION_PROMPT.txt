PROBLEM STATEMENT: Lowe's Scraper - Cost Optimization

CURRENT SITUATION:
Your actor scrapes Lowe's "Pickup Today" inventory across ~50 WA/OR stores and ~291 departments. It works but is economically unviable on Apify - estimated + per full crawl.

WHAT IT DOES NOW:
1. Enqueues ~109K URLs (50 stores × 291 departments × 7-10 pages)
2. Uses Apify Request Queue for parallelization
3. For EACH URL, launches a full Playwright browser instance
4. Applies Akamai anti-bot detection (headless=False, stealth mode, session locking per store)
5. Clicks "Pickup Today" filter on each page
6. Extracts: SKU, title, price, was_price, markdown %, availability, image URL, timestamp
7. Pushes results to Apify dataset

THE COST PROBLEM:
- Each browser instance = 8GB memory × 2 hours timeout = massive compute cost
- 109K URLs × browser launch overhead = astronomical
- Residential proxy bandwidth for 109K requests = additional $
- Current estimate: -500 per full crawl depending on actual runtime

HARD CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- AKAMAI BLOCKING: Lowe's uses Akamai anti-bot detection. Headless browsers get 403 "Access Denied"
- PICKUP FILTER: Must click "Pickup Today" filter to see only in-stock items (can't add to URL params without triggering Akamai)
- DYNAMIC RENDERING: Product data loads via JavaScript; can't scrape raw HTML
- SESSION LOCKING: Must lock proxy session to store_id to prevent Akamai from flagging distributed requests
- MUST BE HEADFUL: headless=False is REQUIRED or Akamai blocks

WHAT SHOULD CHANGE:
1. Browser Session Reuse: Launch ONE browser, keep it alive, cycle through 109K URLs instead of launching 109K browsers
2. Connection Pooling: Reuse HTTP connections and proxy sessions across requests
3. Memory Efficiency: Don't load full page renders; extract only product JSON-LD or minimal DOM
4. Parallelization: If using Playwright, use actual async/concurrent page handling, not sequential browser launches
5. Batching: Group requests by store/category to maintain Akamai session locking while reducing overhead

GOAL:
Reduce per-crawl cost from ~ to ~ (or less) while maintaining Akamai evasion and pickup filter accuracy.

DATA OUTPUT NEEDED:
Same as now: store_id, store_name, SKU, title, category, price, price_was, pct_off, availability, product_url, image_url, timestamp
